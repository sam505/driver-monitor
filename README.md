# Guardian Driver

Due to the high number of accidents that happen annually, I decided to come up with a computer vision
project that aims at tracking the driver's attention at any time the vehicle s on the road. This is achieved by
estimating the head angles and the directions of the driver's eyes.
In case the head angles are beyond the allowed range, the driver is alerted before losing control of the vehicle.
